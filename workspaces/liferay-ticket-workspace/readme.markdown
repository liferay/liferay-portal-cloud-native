# Liferay Ticket Workspace

## Deployment

First we have to enable the below feature flag:

1. Enabling attachments for object entries

    >feature.flag.LPS-174455 = true

1.  Then install the below client extensions in the exact order below:

    1.liferay-ticket-batch-list-type-definition

    2.liferay-ticket-batch-object-definition

    3.liferay-ticket-batch-object-relationship

    4.liferay-ticket-batch-object-entry

    5.liferay-ticket-custom-element

1.  Install the required stylebook

    For the custom element to work correctly, we have to deploy the related stylebook which can be found in **Workspaces** -> **liferay-tryitnow-workspace** -> **client-extensions** -> **liferay-tryitnow-site-initializer** -> **site-initializer** -> **style-books** -> **tryitnow**.

1.  Apply the stylebook

    After deploying the stylebook, we have to apply it to the page which is hosting the custom element and make sure we are using the **Dialect** theme.

## Generating Tickets

To generate random tickets quickly, we can use the **liferay-ticket-custom-element** by navigating to the **Tickets App** page.

We can also use the default object widget under **Control Panel** -> **Objects** -> **J3Y7 Tickets**.
